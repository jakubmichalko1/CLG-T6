            <h3>What is Somnium?</h3>
            <p>
                Somnium is a chip from the newest technologies. It makes your dream game a whole new level. You can
                dream about whatever you wish. An art gallery visit? Done. Exploring a forest? Done. We now have 150+
                themes for your dreams and every day we are working on making even more.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has happened to everyone before that they had a person they dislike in their dreams. No more of that.
                With the latest version of our Somnium app you can pick people that you want in your dream. But if you
                are not in a mood for people, do not worry, you can always choose to be alone.
            </p>
            <p>

                The chip uses a modern software created by our head specialist. Using the connection paste the chip is
                attached to the temple. Your brainwaves are then connected with the chip and thanks to that you can get
                onto dreaming. The program becomes active once you fall asleep, it divides the brain signals that are
                currently working on your dream from the rest and redirects them to your desired theme. All that is left
                to do after that is to enjoy your dream. </p>
